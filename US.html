        <h2>2015</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 324 million</h3>
        <p>The population continued to grow steadily due to factors such as natural increase (births minus deaths), immigration, and improving life expectancy.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info2">
        <h2>2016</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 327 million</h3>
        <p>Population growth remained consistent, driven by births to existing residents and continued immigration, as well as improving healthcare contributing to longer life expectancy.</p>

        <div>
        <h2>2017</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 329 million</h3>
        <p>The population continued to increase steadily due to factors such as natural increase, net immigration, and the aging population.</p>

    <div class="info-section" id="info4">
        <h2>2018</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 332 million</h3>
        <p>Population growth persisted, supported by factors such as ongoing immigration, births exceeding deaths, and economic factors influencing migration patterns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info5">
        <h2>2019</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 334 million</h3>
        <p>The population continued to grow steadily, driven by factors such as births to existing residents, net international migration, and internal migration patterns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info6">
        <h2>2020</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 335 million</h3>
        <p>Population growth remained consistent, influenced by ongoing demographic trends including natural increase, immigration, and changes in fertility rates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info7">
        <h2>2021</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 336 million</h3>
        <p>The population continued to increase steadily, with factors such as births exceeding deaths, net immigration, and economic conditions affecting migration patterns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info8">
        <h2>2022</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 338 million</h3>
        <p>Population growth persisted, supported by factors such as ongoing immigration, births to existing residents, and economic factors driving internal migration.</p>

        <h2>2023</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 339 million</h3>
        <p>The population continued to grow steadily, influenced by ongoing demographic trends including natural increase, immigration, and changes in fertility rates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info10">
        <h2>2024</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 341 million</h3>
        <p>Assuming that previous trends of steady population growth persist, the population could continue to increase gradually, with factors such as births to existing residents, net immigration, and improving life expectancy contributing to overall growth.</p>

        <h2>Natural Effects</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Positive Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Shale oil and gas:</b> The US has vast shale oil and gas reserves, which, if extracted sustainably, can provide a bridge fuel during the transition to renewable energy sources.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Public awareness:</b> Growing public awareness about environmental issues can drive policy changes and consumer behavior towards sustainability.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Technological advancements:</b> The US has a history of innovation in areas like renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info13">
        <h3>Negative Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Obesity rates:</b> High obesity rates in the US can contribute to increased demand for food resources, placing a strain on agricultural systems globally.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Light pollution:</b> Light pollution from a large and geographically dispersed population disrupts ecosystems and astronomical observations.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>High consumption rates:</b> The US lifestyle emphasizes consumption of resources, placing a strain on global resources.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Habitat loss:</b> Development to accommodate a growing population can lead to habitat loss for wildlife, especially in ecologically sensitive areas.</p>
