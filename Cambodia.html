        <h3><b>Population:</b> 7.3 million</h3>
        <p>Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol Pot, came to power in April 1975. The regime initiated radical social and agricultural reforms, forcibly evacuating people from urban areas to rural communes. Mass killings, forced labor, and starvation resulted in a significant decrease in population.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Positive Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Increased agricultural productivity:</b> A growing population can drive investment in more efficient irrigation systems and sustainable farming practices.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Ecotourism potential:</b> A growing population can increase demand for ecotourism, providing economic incentives for conservation efforts.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Renewable energy exploration:</b> With rising energy demands, Cambodia can explore renewable sources like hydropower and solar to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

    <div class="info-section" id="info13">
        <h3>Negative Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Soil erosion:</b> Deforestation for agriculture on steep slopes can lead to severe soil erosion, reducing land productivity in the long run.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Overfishing:</b> Increased pressure on fisheries can lead to overfishing, harming marine ecosystems and livelihoods.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Deforestation:</b> With more people needing resources, forests are threatened to make way for agriculture and fuel sources, impacting biodiversity.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Water pollution:</b> Increased agricultural activity and improper waste disposal can pollute water sources.</p>
