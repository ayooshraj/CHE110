    <div class="info-section" id="info1">
        <h2>1940</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73 million</h3>
        <p>Japan's population continued to grow due to high birth rate and fewer immigrants.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info2">
        <h2>1941</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73.1 million</h3>
        <p>Population growth has been relatively stable with a constant fertility rate and minimal influence from external factors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info3">
        <h2>1942</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73.2 million</h3>
        <p>Despite World War II, Japan's population growth had no impact this year.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info4">
        <h2>1943</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73.4 million</h3>
        <p>Japan's population growth may have slowed somewhat due to wartime conditions, but it still grew modestly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info5">
        <h2>1944</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73.5 million</h3>
        <p>The effect of wartime conditions may have resulted in a slight decline in population compared to previous years.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info6">
        <h2>1945</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 73.2 million</h3>
        <p>At the end of World War II, Japan suffered heavy loss of life due to mines and military conflicts, causing population decline.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info7">
        <h2>1946</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 71.9 million</h3>
        <p>After World War II, Japan faced a severe economic crisis and food shortage, which led to a decline in population due to increased mortality and a shortage of resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info8">
        <h2>1947</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 71.3 million</h3>
        <p>Japan's population continued to decline as the country struggled to recover from the devastation of the war, with ongoing economic challenges contributing to the decline in birth rates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info9">
        <h2>1948</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 70.6 million</h3>
        <p>Economic recovery efforts were slow, and a combination of factors such as low fertility rates, limited resources and social divisions continued to drive population growth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info10">
        <h2>1949</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 69.9 million</h3>
        <p>Despite some progress in economic recovery, Japanâ€™s population continued to decline as the country grappled with post-war challenges, including food shortages and social instability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info11">
        <h2>1950</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 69.3 million</h3>
        <p>The population of Japan was facing the lingering effects of World War II, in which slow economic growth, limited resources and social unrest contributed to a slow population decline.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="info-section" id="info12">
        <h2>Natural Effects</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Positive Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Focus on conservation:</b> Japan has a strong culture of environmental awareness, leading to conservation efforts and resource efficiency practices.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Gerontechnology:</b> Advancements in gerontechnology (technologies for an aging population) can improve resource efficiency in areas like assisted living facilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Social pressure for sustainability:</b> A strong cultural emphasis on environmental responsibility can drive social pressure for sustainable practices.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info13">
        <h3>Negative Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Aging infrastructure:</b> An aging population can put a strain on maintaining and upgrading essential infrastructure for water management and waste disposal.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limited recycling capacity:</b> While Japan has a high recycling rate, keeping pace with growing waste generation from a large population requires ongoing investment in recycling infrastructure.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Limited land and resources:</b> Being an island nation, Japan has limited land and resources, making them even more vulnerable with population growth.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Reliance on imports:</b> Japan relies heavily on resource imports, making them susceptible to price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions.</p>
