        <h2>Natural Effects</h2>
        
        <p>

            1. <b>Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster:</b> On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located near the town of Pripyat in Ukraine, suffered a catastrophic nuclear accident. The explosion and subsequent fire released large amounts of radioactive materials into the atmosphere, causing widespread environmental contamination. The Chernobyl disaster had long-term impacts on public health, agriculture, and the environment, not only in Ukraine but also in neighboring countries and beyond.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            2. <b>Drought:</b> Periods of drought can occur in Ukraine, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. Droughts can negatively impact agriculture, leading to reduced crop yields, water shortages, and economic losses for farmers.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            3. <b>Natural Hazards in Crimea:</b> Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine, is susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and coastal erosion. These hazards can pose risks to infrastructure, homes, and communities in the region.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. <b>Ecological Consequences of Soviet Policies:</b> The environmental legacy of Soviet-era policies, such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and industrialization, continued to affect Ukraine during the period from 1986 to 1996. These practices contributed to soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and other ecological challenges.
