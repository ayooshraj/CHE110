        <h2>Natural Effects</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Positive Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Economic growth:</b> A large workforce has contributed to China's economic boom, potentially generating more resources for environmental protection efforts.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Clean energy investments:</b> China is a major investor in clean energy technologies like solar and wind power, which can help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and air pollution.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Circular economy:</b> A focus on a circular economy that emphasizes recycling and resource efficiency can help mitigate resource depletion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info13">
        <h3>Negative Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Resource depletion:</b> China's vast population places a heavy strain on resources like water, coal, and minerals. This can lead to dependence on imports and environmental damage from resource extraction.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Pollution:</b> Rapid industrialization to meet the demands of a large population has resulted in significant air and water pollution.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Water pollution:</b> Industrial waste and agricultural runoff can severely pollute freshwater resources, impacting public health and ecosystems.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Desertification:</b> Overgrazing and unsustainable land use practices in northern China can contribute to desertification.</p>
