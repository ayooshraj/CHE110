        <h2>2014</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.307 billion</h3>
        <p>India's population continued to grow steadily due to factors such as high birth rates, improving healthcare leading to lower infant mortality rates, and limited success in family planning initiatives.</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info2">
        <h2>2015</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.322 billion</h3>
        <p>The launch of the “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” campaign in 2015, aimed at promoting gender equality, led to a slight increase in the female population.</p>

        <h2>2016</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.338 billion</h3>
        <p>TThe Indian government’s increased focus on healthcare might have contributed to a decrease in the mortality rate.</p>

    <div class="info-section" id="info4">
        <h2>2017</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.354 billion</h3>
        <p>The implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017 could have had an indirect impact on population growth, as economic changes can influence population trends.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info5">
        <h2>2018</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.369 billion</h3>
        <p>Population growth remained high due to ongoing high birth rates, cultural norms favoring larger families, and challenges in implementing effective family planning programs nationwide.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info6">
        <h2>2019</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.383 billion</h3>
        <p>Despite some progress in family planning initiatives, India's population continued to grow rapidly due to persistent high fertility rates, particularly in rural areas, and limited access to contraception for certain populations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info7">
        <h2>2020</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.396 billion</h3>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, which affected the population growth due to increased mortality.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info8">
        <h2>2021</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.407 billion</h3>
        <p>The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program in 2021 might have helped reduce the mortality rate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info9">
        <h2>2022</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.417 billion</h3>
        <p>Despite efforts to promote family planning and reproductive health, India's population continued to grow rapidly due to factors such as high birth rates, limited access to contraception in some regions, and cultural preferences for larger families.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info10">
        <h2>2023</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.428 billion</h3>
        <p>India's population continued to increase steadily due to ongoing high birth rates, improving healthcare, and cultural norms favoring larger families in certain regions.</p>

    <div class="info-section" id="info11">
        <h2>2024</h2>
        <h3><b>Population:</b> 1.441 billion</h3>
        <p>Assuming that previous trends of high birth rates, improving healthcare, and cultural norms favoring larger families persist, India's population could continue to grow steadily. Additionally, factors such as urbanization, migration, and government policies may also influence population growth.</p>

        <h2>Natural Effects</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Positive Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Increased innovation:</b> India's large population creates a vast pool of talent for innovation in resource management and sustainable practices. This could lead to advancements in areas like precision agriculture, water conservation techniques, and renewable energy sources.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Economic growth:</b> A larger workforce can contribute to India's economic expansion. This, in turn, could generate more resources for environmental protection initiatives like pollution control and forest conservation programs.</p>
        <br>
        
    </div>
    <div class="info-section" id="info13">
        <h3>Negative Effects:</h3>
        
        <p><b>Resource depletion:</b> India's massive and growing population places a significant strain on natural resources. This includes water scarcity, pressure on fertile land for agriculture, and the depletion of fossil fuels.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Pollution:</b> Industrial activity and waste generation associated with a large population contribute to air, water, and soil pollution. This can have severe health consequences and harm ecosystems.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Land degradation:</b> The increased pressure to cultivate land for agriculture can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and desertification. This reduces land productivity and contributes to biodiversity loss.</p>
